<h2><span style="color: red;">About Us</h2>

<p><span style="color: darkblue;">Our system is an automatic system. In the existing system we know if a Blood seeker wants blood, he has to go the hospitals, blood banks available in his location or nearby. In the same way if donor wants to give blood, he has to search for blood donation centers manually. It is very risky process and it will take lot of time. Our system will make the interaction between the Admin, Hospital, Donors and Recipient very quickly which saves lots of time. Our System can give the good security for user information because data is not in client machine. Authentication is provided for this application only registered users can access. There is no risk of data management at any level while the project development is under process. It should be the great system if we implement it in advance level and will be very helpful for all of us. </p>
